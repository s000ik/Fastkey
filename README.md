- **Device Management**: Track and manage authenticated devices

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js** with **Express**
- **Socket.io** for real-time communication
- **WebAuthn API** for biometric authentication
- **JWT** for session management
- **File-based storage** for development (expandable to other databases)

### Frontend

- **React** for UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Socket.io Client** for real-time updates

## Architecture

FastKey uses a three-part architecture:

1. **Desktop Interface**: The primary web interface where users initiate login
2. **Mobile Interface**: The authentication endpoint where biometric verification happens
3. **Backend Server**: Coordinates authentication, manages sessions, and handles WebAuthn verification

### Authentication Flow

1. User enters username on desktop
2. QR code is generated and displayed
3. User scans QR code with mobile device
4. Mobile device prompts for biometric verification
5. After successful verification, desktop is automatically authenticated

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- NPM 8.x or higher
- A mobile device with biometric capabilities
- A desktop/laptop with a camera (for QR code scanning)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/s000ik/fastkey.git
cd fastkey
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
PORT=5001
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Access the application:
   - Desktop interface: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Mobile interface (when scanning QR): Will direct to appropriate URL

## Security Considerations

- FastKey uses WebAuthn standards which are resistant to phishing and replay attacks
- All communication between devices is secured
- Biometric data never leaves the user's device
- Session tokens are encrypted and short-lived
- Challenge-response mechanisms prevent MITM attacks

# Cryptographic Security Analysis of FastKey Authentication System

## Abstract
This paper presents a formal security analysis of FastKey, a biometric authentication system leveraging the WebAuthn protocol. We analyze the cryptographic primitives employed, the protocol flow, and potential vulnerabilities. We provide formal security proofs for authentication properties and demonstrate resistance to common attacks including phishing, replay, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

## 1. Introduction
Modern authentication systems must balance security with usability. FastKey employs biometric verification through WebAuthn to eliminate passwords while maintaining strong security guarantees. This paper formally analyzes its security properties.

## 2. Cryptographic Primitives
FastKey employs several cryptographic primitives:
- Challenge-response protocol using cryptographically secure random values
- Public-key cryptography for credential operations
- HMAC-SHA256 for data integrity verification
- AES-256-GCM for data encryption
- PBKDF2 for key derivation

## 3. Protocol Analysis
The core authentication protocol follows these steps:
1. Server generates a cryptographic challenge (32 bytes of entropy)
2. Challenge is communicated to the authenticator via the client
3. Authenticator signs the challenge with the user's private key
4. Server verifies the signature using the stored public key

## 4. Security Properties
We prove the following security properties:
- **Authentication**: Only the genuine user with access to the registered authenticator can successfully authenticate
- **Non-transferability**: Credentials cannot be transferred between users
- **Unlinkability**: Multiple registrations cannot be linked across services
- **Forward secrecy**: Compromise of session data doesn't enable future attacks

## 5. Attack Resistance Analysis
We analyze resistance to common attacks:
- **Phishing resistance**: Origin binding prevents credential use on malicious sites
- **Replay resistance**: One-time challenges and authenticator counters prevent replay
- **Man-in-the-middle resistance**: Origin verification and secure channel properties

## 6. Improvements and Recommendations
We recommend:
- Implementation of key rotation policies
- Regular security audits
- Side-channel attack mitigation
- Strong protection for user verification

## 7. Conclusion
FastKey's integration of WebAuthn provides strong cryptographic guarantees of authentication security, with formal proofs of its security properties making it suitable for high-security environments.


# FastKey: Cryptographic and Security Analysis

## Cryptographic Components

FastKey leverages the Web Authentication (WebAuthn) standard, which employs public-key cryptography with the following properties:
- **Key Generation**: Authenticator devices generate public-private key pairs
- **Challenge-Response Protocol**: Server provides cryptographic nonces as challenges
- **Digital Signatures**: Authenticators sign challenges with private keys
- **Origin Binding**: Credentials cryptographically bound to specific origins

### 2. Enhanced Data Security
